Hello! I'm a passionate software developer in my second year of college, specializing in creating innovative solutions that make a difference. Up until now, I've honed my skills across various domains and technologies, working on projects such as loan prediction models and SONAR prediction along with being a research intern at DRDO.

I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy tackling complex problems. My approach combines analytical thinking with creative problem-solving, always keeping the end-user experience in mind.

### Key Interests:
- Machine Learning
- Web Development
- UI/UX Design

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing badminton or hitting the gym. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies and open to exciting opportunities that challenge me to grow both professionally and personally.

### Project Overview: SONAR Data Classification and Loan Eligibility Prediction System

This project involves building a comprehensive system that serves two main purposes: predicting whether an object is a Rock or Mine using SONAR data and determining loan eligibility for individuals. The system leverages Python-based machine learning models and is integrated into a web application designed to assist with financial needs, transactions, and personalized advice.

#### Features:
- **SONAR Data Classification**: Uses a Logistic Regression model to classify objects based on SONAR data as either Rock or Mine.
- **Loan Eligibility Prediction**: Implements machine learning algorithms to predict loan eligibility based on applicant data.
- **Web Application Integration**: Provides real-time predictions and financial assistance.
- **Financial Advising**: Offers personalized advice and supports financial transactions.
